# Neural_Style_Transfer
This project consists of explore how the **style
transfer** algorithm works.
Style transfer is an image processing technique by which the style and textures from one image can be transferred onto another image. 
It starts with the image that we want to transform and we'll call
this the content image. In this project it can be seen that it's a dog. Then there's the
image that gives us the style that we want to convert our image into.  We'll call that the style image. It can be seen that ItÂ´s a painting. From these, we'll create a new image that we'll call the generated image.

The file on which the work is done is **Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb**

As a result of running the notebook, two gifs are obtained:

  - **style_transfer.gif**

  - **style_transfer_reg.gif**
