# Neural_Style_Transfer
This project consists of explore how the **style
transfer** algorithm works.
Style transfer is an image processing technique by which the style and textures from one image can be transferred onto another image. For example, if we take the image of the dog in the middle of the screen, we can combine it with the image of a painting on the left. The results will be a stylized version of the dog as you can see on the right-hand side.
It starts with the image that we want to transform and we'll call
this the content image. Here we can see it's a dog. Then there's the
image that gives us the style that we want to convert our image into.  We'll call that the style image. From these, we'll create a new image that we'll call the generated image.

The file on which the work is done is **Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb**

As a result of running the notebook, two gifs are obtained:

  - **style_transfer.gif**

  - **style_transfer_reg.gif**
